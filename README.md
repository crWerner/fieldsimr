# FieldSimR #

**FieldSimR** is an R package for simulating realistic plot data in multi-environment field trials with one or more traits. Its core function generates plot errors comprising:

- **spatially correlated error** (trend),
- **random error** (noise), and 
- **extraneous error**. 

Spatially correlated errors are simulated using either bivariate interpolation or a separable first order autoregressive process (AR1:AR1). The three error terms are combined at a user-defined ratio. 

Plot phenotypes can be generated by combining the simulated errors with genetic values (e.g. true, simulated or predicted). **FieldSimR** provides wrapper functions to simulate genetic values for multiple traits across multiple environments using the **R** package [AlphaSimR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR).
