# FieldSimR

**FieldSimR** is an R package to enable simulation of plot data in field trials for multiple traits across multiple environments. Its core function generates plot errors comprising 
1) a spatially correlated error term,
2) a random error term, and 
3) an extraneous error term. 

Spatially correlated errors are simulated using either bivariate interpolation or a two-dimensional autoregressive process of order one (AR1:AR1). The three error terms are combined at a user-defined ratio. 

Plot phenotypes can be generated by combinating the simulated errors with genetic values (e.g. true, simulated or predicted). **FieldSimR** provides wrapper functions to simulate genetic values for multiple traits across multiple environments using the **R** package [AlphaSimR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR).
