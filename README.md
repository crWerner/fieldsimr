# FieldSimR #

**FieldSimR** is an R package for simulating plot data in multi-environment field trials with one or more traits. Its core function generates plot errors that capture:

- **spatial trend**,
- **random error (noise)**, and 
- **extraneous variation**. 

Spatial trend is simulated using bivariate interpolation or a separable first order autoregressive (AR1) process. Random error is simulated using an independent process. Extraneous variation is simulated using random or zig-zag ordering between neighbouring columns and/or rows. The three error components are combined at a user-defined ratio. 

Phenotypes can be generated by combining the simulated plot errors with genetic values (e.g., true, simulated, or predicted). **FieldSimR** provides wrapper functions to simulate correlated genetic values that capture genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction with the R package [AlphaSimR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaSimR).
