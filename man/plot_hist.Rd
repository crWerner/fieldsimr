\title{Histogram of effects.}
\usage{
plot_hist(df, effect = NULL, bins = 30, density = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or vector with the effects to be plotted.}

\item{effect}{A character defining the effects to be plotted. Ignored when 'df' is a vector.}

\item{bins}{Argument passed to \code{ggplot2} (default is \code{30}). Controls the number
of bins in the histogram.}

\item{density}{When \code{TRUE} (default is \code{FALSE}), a density curve is superimposed
onto the histogram.}
}
\value{
A histogram with x- and y-axes displaying the values and their frequency, respectively.
  When \code{density = TRUE}, a density curve is superimposed onto the histogram.
}
\description{
Creates a histogram of user-defined effects.

\examples{
# Histogram of the simulated plot errors in the example data frame 'error_df_bivar'
# for Trait 1 in Environment 1.
error_df <- error_df_bivar[error_df_bivar$env == 1, ]
plot_hist(
  df = error_df,
  effect = "e.Trait1",
  density = TRUE
)
