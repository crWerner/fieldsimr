Description: Simulates plot data in multi-environment field trials with one or more traits. 
  Its core function generates plot errors that capture spatial trend, random error (noise), 
  and extraneous variation, which are combined at a user-defined ratio. 
  Phenotypes can be generated by combining the plot errors with simulated genetic values that capture 
  genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction using wrapper functions for the R package `AlphaSimR`.
